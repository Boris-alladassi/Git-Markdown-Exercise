Command | Explanation
------- | -----------
git status | Show me the tracked and untracked files
git add | To stage or start tracking files
git commit | To commit the changes made
git push | To send our changes to the remote server if permission is granted.

Some very useful git commands that I have learnt so far are:  

``` git clone ```  
``` git push ```  
```git add ```  
``` git pull ```  
``` git branch <branch name>```  
``` git branch``` this helps to list all the existing branches  
``` git checkout <branch name>``` to switch to anoter branch  
```git log```  
```git diff```  
```git status```
